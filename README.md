## Main React Components

- `App` (in `App.jsx`): The main component that manages the application state, user login, and coordinates data retrieval through API calls. It also handles routing logic to display different sections of the application.
- `Layout` (in `App.jsx`): A component defining the basic structure of the user interface, including the header (used also to display messages) and the footer. It uses Container, Row, and Col from React-Bootstrap to organize elements.
- `TicketList` (in `TicketComponents.jsx`): Manages multiple tickets displayed in rows. Includes an "Add Ticket" button for logged-in users and renders each ticket using the Ticket component. Handles initial loading state and navigation for adding new tickets.
- `Ticket` (in `TicketComponents.jsx`): Represents an individual ticket displayed with a Card. Features include expanding to show details and managing state changes and category updates for authorized users. Admins can change categories and update ticket states. It also displays associated comments displayed in a card as well.
- `TextBlockForm` (in `TextBlockForm.jsx`): Handles the form for adding comments to a specific ticket (ticketId). Includes state management for text input (text), loading state for a reactive interface (loading), and error messages (errorMsg). Features include form validation, submission of text blocks, and navigation controls (navigate). Displays alerts for validation errors and handles user authentication (loggedIn).
- `TicketForm` (in `TicketForm.jsx`): Manages the form for adding a new ticket. Allows users to input a title, select a category, and provide a description. Features include form validation, confirmation step (isConfirming), and handling of loading states (loading). Users receive a prediction of closure time based on selected category and title.
- `LoginForm` (in `LoginComponents.jsx`): Manages the user login process with fields for username (email) and password. Handles form submission, authentication via API (API.login), and error handling for incorrect credentials.
